# Sandwich Club Project Starter Code

## Project Overview
In this project, I completed an app called the **Sandwich Club** which shows the details of each sandwich once it is selected. The purpose was to practice parsing information (JSON) and displaying this to the user in a basic interface set up in a tight time scheldule. 

## Why this Project

Building a layout and populating its fields from data received as JSON
is a common task for Android Developers. Although JSON parsing is usually
done using libraries (such as GSON), writing the JSON parsing for this project
helped me better understand how it is processed.

## What I Learned?
Through this project, I:
- Learned how to submit projects to supervisors for review
- Practiced JSON parsing to a model object
- Designed an activity layout
- Populated all fields in the layout accordingly/appropriately.
